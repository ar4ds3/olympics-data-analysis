The olympics data analysis depicts the observations based on the information provided in the dataset.
The Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas were effectively used to derive an expected output.
Functions and List also played an important role in wrangling the data.
Visualizing the data is a different science altogether, and to achieve it, one should be able to understand the basics of simplfying the data and make it presenatble to stakeholders.
This project walks through the olypmic data and helps us understand the performance at various level.
This also helps us compute the prospective best performers in the upcoming seasons.
